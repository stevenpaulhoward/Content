## Materials in visionOS [00:54](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202?time=54)

> _Materials are what define the appearance of your object in 3D scenes. Materials can be simple, just a single color, or they can use images._

Materials can be simple, sophisticated, and even modify geometry. Materials in visionOS use Physically Based Rendering (PBR) to represent physical properties of real world objects. Examples of PBR materials shown at [1:44](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202?time=104)

Materials consist of one or more **shaders**. These are programs that do the actual work of computing the appearance of their material.

**Surface shaders** operate on the PBR attributes of models. **Geometry modifiers** operate on the geometry of your objects.

RealityKit2 for iOS and iPadOS introduced CustomMaterial. For visionOS, a new type of material is introduced: **ShaderGraphMaterial**.

### ShaderGraphMaterial

- **This is the exclusive way of creating custom materials for visionOS**.
- Based on the open standard [MaterialX](https://materialx.org).
- Supports 2 main types of shaders: **Physically Based** and **Custom**.
    - _Physically based shader is intended for simpler use cases (e.g. constant, non-changing values)_
    - _Custom is intended for precise and custom control over 3D objects (e.g. animation, geometry modifiers, special effects, etc._
- Build ShaderGraphMaterials using the Shader Graph Editor directly inside Reality Composer Pro.

## Material editing [03:37](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202?time=217)

**Quick Tips**
- add a material by clicking the `+` icon inside the Project Browser
- double-click on the back of the node editor to add nodes
- drag from an empty node output to create a new node connection rather than double-clicking then connecting

- New custom shaders start with two nodes, the **surface node** in purple and the **outputs node** in blue. The inputs on the **surface** are how you set your shader's PBR parameters.
- `separate3` node allows you to extract the XYZ coordinate positions.
- `modulo` node gives the remainder of dividing 2 values.

**Important!** make sure you assign your new material to your model in the hierarchy. You do this by selecting your custom material from the model's Material Binding dropdown in the inspector [5:48](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202?time=349).

## Node graphs [10:25](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202?time=625)

> _Node graphs help simplify complex materials and let you create your own nodes to reuse parts of graphs._

**Quick Tips**
- Multi-select any set of nodes and right-click > Compose Node Graph to make reusable node components [11:21](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202?time=681).
- In the project hierarchy, right-click > Create Instance to create an instance of your node graph [11:35](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202?time=695).
- Add inputs and outputs to your node graph in the inspector [12:10](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202?time=730).

**Instances** of node graphs are live copies that **adopt any changes made to the original node graph**. They inherit inputs and outputs added to the original node graph it points to.

## Geometry modifiers [13:15](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202?time=796)

> _A feature of custom materials you can use to modify your models in real time._

**Reminder** _Surface shaders operate on the PBR attributes while Geometry modifiers operate on the geometry of objects._

This section jumps right into a walk-through tutorial on applying heightmaps to generate geometry, and animating between those heightmaps. Starts at [13:46](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202?time=826).

In order to build a geometry modifier, you need to add a `Geometry Modifier Input` node, and connect it to the output node [15:23](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202?time=923).

Geometry modifiers can move the vertices of geometry in any direction. To specify a direction to move vertices, use the `Combine3` node to create a 3D vector and set it to the XYZ axis you want to manipulate [16:15](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202?time=975).

### How to add a normal map to geometry [16:53](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202?time=1013)

1. Add an `Image` node and input the normal map.
2. Use a `Remap` node to adjust normal range from 0:1 to -1:1 if needed.

### How to dynamically animate between geometry modifiers [17:26](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202?time=1046)

![Schematic of how to use the mix node to animate between geometry modifiers.][mix-node]

[mix-node]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10202/mix-node.png

1. Add `Mix` nodes to blend between 2 sets of texture maps.
2. Add and connect a `Constant` to the `Mix` nodes, and set the value between 0:1 to control which texture set is shown.
3. Right click the `Constant` node, and convert it using the Promote command.
4. Dynamically animate inside your Swift code. Walk-through of this step can be found in the session [Work with Reality Composer Pro content in Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10273).
